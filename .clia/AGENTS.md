# Agent Instructions

- Format modified Swift files with `swift format -i -r -p` before committing.
- Prefer line-scoped disables such as `// swiftlint:disable:this` instead of disable/enable blocks.
- Use the `WrkstrmPerformance` CLI to run external commands and capture metrics when validating
  performance hypotheses.
