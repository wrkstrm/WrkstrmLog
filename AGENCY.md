# WrkstrmLog Release Naming
Releases adopt tree species codenames in alphabetical order to mirror logging.
The series began with v2.1.0 "Aspen" and will continue with "Birch", "Cedar", etc.
Include the codename alongside the semantic version in release pages and documentation.

## Formatting
Swift code should be formatted with `swift format --configuration https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrkstrm/configs/main/linting/.swift-format -i -r -p`. This is the only Swift formatting step to run.
